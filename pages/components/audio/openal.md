it's been a long time since I worked on this, so I might not remember much off the top of my head currently. but our current setup works to play sound effects, and our sound effects are capable of overlapping.
#### Formats
  * Right now we use .ogg audio.
#### TODO
  * Get audio streaming working so we can reduce memory usage for things like background music.
  * figure something out to handle excessive overlapping sound effects so we reduce memory usage, and avoid distortion.
  * look into pitch shifting to reduce the noise fatigue effect.
  * on the note from above, look into general audio manipulation for many different elements.
