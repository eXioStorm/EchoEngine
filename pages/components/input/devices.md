#### Keyboard & mouse
  * As much as I want to allow multi-keyboard support, from what I've been able to find is that people only accomplish this via OS virtualization which also requires your hardware to support it. 
    the windows operating system has only ever been designed to have one user at a time, and despite many people requesting for this to be resolved microsoft has not made any progress.
    it wouldn't be impossible to write something for this, but the required expertise to write drivers, or any API to intercept USB traffic for this is far far **FAR** outside of my expertise to accomplish.
    The best shot I have at implementing this feature is to write it for linux, as linux is a lot more straight-forward with accessing lower level data. This is a highly desired feature.
  * Would like to make all 24 f-keys configurable.

#### Microphone
  * Usefulness of this feature cannot be under-stated. must add this feature, with configurable proximity chat. will likely be part of Matrix incorporation.
#### Webcam
  * only if part of Matrix incorporation. this feature is quite low-priority.

#### MIDI devices
  * Certainly adding MIDI device support, can absolutely see them being useful for playing sound-fonts.

#### Gaming Controllers
  * Some people just prefer controllers, and controllers are pretty much required for PC multiplayer. (*for now*. \*winks\*)

#### Touch-Screen
  * Will probably add touch-screen support of some sort.
