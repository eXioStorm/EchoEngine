# Style?
* Our main core idea currently is to have a `2D side-scroller metroidvania style platformer`?, however we would like to eventually add top-down support for minigames.
## General notes
* need to remember to incorporate logic for identical adjacent surfaces combining into a single collision surface to avoid issues with collisions bugging and slipping in-between tiles.
